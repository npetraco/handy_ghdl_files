Handy examples and templates to do simple commodity stuff in VHDL via ghdl. 
Assumes ghdl, bash and make are installed. Should be operating system
agnostic except for how gtkwave is called. I use a Mac, so that is the
command sequence you will see in the bash scripts (i.e. look for the
"open" command). Just change it for the operating system you use. The
scripts are so simple this should be pretty easy to figure
out.

Typically all this is used in conjunction with
simulation. Most code in here IS NOT synthesizable.

Hopefully it will save the interested hobbyist a little googling.
