Handy examples and templates to do simple commodity stuff in VHDL via ghdl. 
Assumes ghdl, bash and make are installed. Should be operating system
agnostic. Typically all this is used in conjunction with
simulation. Most code in here IS NOT synthesizable.

Hopefully it will save the interested hobbyist a little googling.
