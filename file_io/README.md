Execute:
./cln
./chk

Then:
./run2
	To get a get a random set of 1 byte signals and a .ghk file. 
        Plot in gtk wave.
./rerun2
	If code is changed, handy to regenerate the .ghk file but NOT gen 
        a new set of random bytes NOR reset gtkwave.
./rerun2s
	Same as rerun2 but get a new set of random bytes.
